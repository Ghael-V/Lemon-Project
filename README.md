## About this fork (Lemon-Project)

This is a private, Android-only fork of [Eden](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden), trimmed down to just the
Android app and its build system (no Qt/desktop/CLI/dedicated-room targets, no multi-platform CI). It exists to
run on a single Android device with no dependency on a PC build.

`prod.keys` and firmware are **not** part of this repository and never will be — obtaining them from your own
legally owned console is entirely on you. This fork does not touch key derivation, decryption, or DRM in any way;
it only builds the emulator app.

For anything not Android-specific (compatibility, general usage, most of the docs below), refer to
[upstream Eden](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden) — this fork doesn't change emulation behavior, only what
gets built and how.

## Compatibility

The emulator is capable of running most commercial games at full speed, provided you meet the necessary hardware requirements.

A list of supported games will be available in future. Please be patient.

Check out our [website](https://eden-emu.dev) for the latest news on exciting features, monthly progress reports, and more!
